# Onward

This app was built for the Indy Civic Hack as a way for recently un-incarcerated individuals to set goals for themselves and track their progress in a gamified and engaging way. They recieve points for achieveing goals and level up as they go. This proof of concept could be expanded into physical rewards if needed. It was a great project with some great people, and we certainly learned a lot.
